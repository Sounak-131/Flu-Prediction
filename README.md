# Flu-Prediction
In this Project, we will predict how likely individuals will receive their xyz and seasonal flu vaccines based on the given dataset. There are certain features shown on the dataset like gender, age, doctor recommendations, behavioral characteristics, etc. Also on the given dataset, there were some null values given, so during EDA, I filled those null values with the majority repeating elements (For example - there are 1000 elements, and 9 of them were blank, 900 had the bool 'True' and remaining 91 had 'False'. So, this way I filled 9 blanks with 'True' as it was the majority element). After EDA, I also removed some unnecessary columns like address, columns which had so many null values and so on.  After EDA, I finally trained the data by logistic regression which showed 80 percent accuracy (by cross-validation where we split in 4:1 ratio).
